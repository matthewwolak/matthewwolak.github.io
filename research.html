		  <p>Human societies generally consider inbreeding, or incestuous mating with a close relative, taboo. Many people also know that inbreeding is often bad for resulting kids, and hence best avoided. However, many wild animals and plants commonly inbreed causing scientists to wonder why individuals don't always avoid incestuous matings?</p>

		
		  <p>In collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbs/people/profiles/jane.reid">Jane Reid</a>, I used 40 years of data collected from a wild population of song sparrows (<em>Melospiza melodia</em>) inhabiting Mandarte island (British Columbia, Canada) to calculate the degree to which inbreeding was due to individuals' genes versus environment. The song sparrow population provides a unique opportunity to undertake such analyses, because the relatedness among all sparrows hatched in the population since 1975 is known with exceptionally high accuracy.</p>

		      <div class="img-desc">Biparental inbreeding is an 'emergent', or shared, trait in song sparrows. In our model the observed level of inbreeding, measured by the coefficient of kinship (<em>k</em> ), is an emergent property of the male and female in a social pair. Social pairing, and hence kinship between mates, can be attributed to additive genetic values (a), immigrant genetic effects (I) and inbreeding effects (coefficient of inbreeding - <em>f</em>) of both males and females.</div>

		  <p>A mixed model analysis, including both indirect genetic effects and genetic group effects<!-- TODO link to GG paper-->, was used to model the degree of inbreeding through social pairing as an emergent trait of each pair. We showed that the degree of biparental inbreeing is heritable, implying that the population mean could actually evolve and hence become more or less over time. We also found a high between-sex additive genetic correlation. Consequently, differences in sex-specific selection could lead to evolutionary sexual conflict over the degree of biparental inbreeding (here is a <a target="_blank" href="pdf/Wolak2016PairingWithARelativeHeritable_Fem&MaleGenContributionsInbreedingSOSP.pdf">pdf of the paper</a> for more details).</p>

		  <p>The results provide new insights into what drives mating between relatives and what the consequences might be for small populations where inbreeding is likely to occur. The findings are a key first step in determining how organisms mate in nature which is essential to knowing how wild populations will adapt to their environment and evolve over time.</p>
