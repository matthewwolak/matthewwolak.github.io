		<h2>Biparental Inbreeding</h2>
		  <h4>'Nature vs. Nurture' of Incest</h4>

		  <p>Human societies generally consider inbreeding, or incestuous mating with a close relative, taboo. Many people also know that inbreeding is often bad for resulting kids, and hence best avoided. However, many wild animals and plants commonly inbreed causing scientists to wonder why individuals don't always avoid incestuous matings?</p>
		
		  <p>In collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbs/people/profiles/jane.reid">Jane Reid</a>, I used 40 years of data collected from a wild population of song sparrows (<em>Melospiza melodia</em>) inhabiting Mandarte island (British Columbia, Canada) to calculate the degree to which inbreeding was due to individuals' genes versus environment. The song sparrow population provides a unique opportunity to undertake such analyses, because the relatedness among all sparrows hatched in the population since 1975 is known with exceptionally high accuracy.</p>

		      <div class="img-desc">Biparental inbreeding is an 'emergent', or shared, trait in song sparrows. In our model the observed level of inbreeding, measured by the coefficient of kinship (<em>k</em> ), is an emergent property of the male and female in a social pair. Social pairing, and hence kinship between mates, can be attributed to additive genetic values (a), immigrant genetic effects (I) and inbreeding effects (coefficient of inbreeding - <em>f</em>) of both males and females.</div>

		  <p>A mixed model analysis, including both indirect genetic effects and genetic group effects<!-- TODO link to GG paper-->, was used to model the degree of inbreeding through social pairing as an emergent trait of each pair. We showed that the degree of biparental inbreeing is heritable, implying that the population mean could actually evolve and hence become more or less over time. We also found a high between-sex additive genetic correlation. Consequently, differences in sex-specific selection could lead to evolutionary sexual conflict over the degree of biparental inbreeding (here is a <a target="_blank" href="pdf/Wolak2016PairingWithARelativeHeritable_Fem&MaleGenContributionsInbreedingSOSP.pdf">pdf of the paper</a> for more details).</p>

		  <p>The results provide new insights into what drives mating between relatives and what the consequences might be for small populations where inbreeding is likely to occur. The findings are a key first step in determining how organisms mate in nature which is essential to knowing how wild populations will adapt to their environment and evolve over time.</p> 







		<h2>Sexual Dimorphism</h2>
		  <h4>Quantitative Genetic Architecture of Sexually Dimorphic Traits</h4>

    		      <div class="img-desc">Sexual dimorphisms are differences between females and males in their sizes, shapes, colors, etc. These differences can often be extreme. In some populations of the water strider (<em>Aquarius remigis</em>), male (individual on the top) genital segments can be 200% larger than the corresponding structures in females (on the bottom). Whereas, female body size is 70% larger than male body size. Photo credit: M. Wolak.</div>

		  <p>Phenotypic differences between females and males, or sexual dimorphisms, are widely observed in organisms with separate sexes<!-- TODO create a hyperlink with popup image of Daphne's book cover and description about how this book illustrates some really cool/extreme examples -->. Since the sexes share the majority of their genomes, evolutionary biologists are faced with a problem. How do we explain the large differences between the sexes, when mothers pass on female-favorable alleles to their sons and fathers do the same to their daughters?</p>

		  <p>Given the many observed instances of the sexes responding to selection in opposite directions, this implies the existence of sex-specific genetic variation. What mechanisms create sex-specific genetic variation within a population and how might they differ among populations?</p>

		  <p>Current theory suggests sex-linkage of sex-specific genetic effects as a mechanism underlying the genetic architecture of sexually dimorphic traits. Alternatively, it is hypothesized that sex-specific non-additive effects may be a separate mechanism. I have been working in collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Fairbairn.html">Daphne Fairbairn</a> to test these two hypotheses using populations of the water strider (<em>Aquarius remigis</em>).</p>
