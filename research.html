		<h3>Biparental Inbreeding</h3>

		  <p class="floating-text">Human societies generally consider inbreeding, or incestuous mating with a close relative, taboo. Many people also know that inbreeding is often bad for resulting kids, and hence best avoided. However, many wild animals and plants commonly inbreed causing scientists to wonder why individuals don't always avoid incestuous matings?</p>

		
		  <p>In collaboration with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/sbs/people/profiles/jane.reid">Jane Reid</a>, I used 40 years of data collected from a wild population of song sparrows (<em>Melospiza melodia</em>) inhabiting Mandarte island (British Columbia, Canada) to calculate the degree to which inbreeding was due to individuals' genes versus environment. The song sparrow population provides a unique opportunity to undertake such analyses, because the relatedness among all sparrows hatched in the population since 1975 is known with exceptionally high accuracy.</p>

		  <div class="desc">Biparental inbreeding is an 'emergent', or shared, trait in song sparrows. In our model, additive genetic (a), immigrant genetic (I) and inbreeding (coefficient of inbreeding - <em>f</em>) effects of both males and females underly the observed level of inbreeding, measured by the coefficient of kinship <em>k</em>.</div>
		</div>

		  <p>A mixed model analysis, implementing both indirect genetic effects and genetic group effects, was used to model the degree of inbreeding through social pairing as an emergent trait of each pair. We showed that the degree of relatedness between an individual and its social mate was partially determined by each individual's genes and the genes of its social mate. Such genetic “heritability" implies that the population average in the degree to which individuals inbreed could actually evolve and hence become more or less over time.

		  <p>We also found a high between-sex additive genetic correlation. Consequently, differences in sex-specific selection could lead to evolutionary sexual conflict over the degree of biparental inbreeding. Finally, genetic group effects <!-- TODO link to GG paper --> allowed us to include immigrants into our genetic analyses. We found that immigrants contribute lower genetic values for biparental inbreeding.</p>

		  <p>The results provide new insights into what drives mating between relatives and what the consequences might be for small populations where inbreeding is likely to occur. The findings are a key first step in determining how organisms mate in nature which is essential to knowing how wild populations will adapt to their environment and evolve over time.</p>
