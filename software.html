      			<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Sex-linkage</h3>
I have created some R functions to construct sex-chromosome relationship
matrices.&nbsp; These matrices are analagous to the typical Numerator
Relationship Matrix (often referred to as <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span>).&nbsp; However, these sex-linked relationship matrices differ from <span style="font-weight: bold;">A</span> as a result of the difference in inheritance patterns between autosomes and sex chromosomes.&nbsp; I have developed algorithms based on the one presented in Fernando and Grossman (TAG 1990 vol. 80) to also facilitate construction of the relationship matrices under different models of global sex chromosomal dosage compensation (e.g., random X-inactivation).<br>
      <br>

This will enable researchers to estimate sex-linked
additive genetic variance using a range of animal model software
programs (i.e., ASReml, WOMBAT, MCMCglmm).&nbsp; Please don't hesitate to
leave feedback through the GitHub page for nadiv if you have any comments or suggestions.

      			<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Non-additive genetic variances</span></h3>

I made the R package <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">nadiv</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span>on-<span style="font-weight: bold;">AD</span>ditive <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>n<span style="font-weight: bold;">V</span>erse),
to facilitate the estimation of non-additive genetic variances using
the linear mixed effects model known as the 'animal model'.&nbsp; The
package includes functions to compute the inverse of autosomal and sex-chromosomal additive, autosomal dominance, and autosomal epistatic (digenic) relatedness matrices from a pedigree.&nbsp; The output can be used by common animal model software programs
(e.g., MCMCglmm, ASReml, WOMBAT, etc.).&nbsp; There are a number of
other functions included in the package that are quite useful when dealing with pedigrees or running animal models. &nbsp; For example, 'proLik()' constructs
profile likelihoods of variance components from an ASReml-R mixed
model, 'aiFun()' creates a (co)variance and correlation matrix from the sampling (co) variances of the random effects in an ASReml-R model object.&nbsp; Also, 'findDFC()'
will show you which pairs of individuals in a pedigree are double first
cousins as well as indicate the number of families where you get these
relationships.&nbsp; Knowing this information is useful for
understanding the extent to which maternal permanent environment
effects can be separated from dominance genetic effects.<br>
      <br>

The package is available on CRAN <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">(<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</a>)</span>.&nbsp; I have a paper published in <a href="wolakcv.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-style: italic;">Methods in Ecology and Evolution</span></a> which
introduces <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">nadiv</span> and gives explanations for some of the main
functions.&nbsp; The paper includes Supplementary
Information, which contains examples on how to use the output of <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">nadiv</span> in MCMCglmm, ASReml-R, ASReml, and WOMBAT.&nbsp; Feel free to leave feedback through the GitHub page for nadiv.<br>

      			<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">Repeatability</span></h3>

I have created an R package, <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace; font-weight: bold;">ICC</span>, to be used in the estimation of the <span style="font-weight: bold;">I</span>ntraclass <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>orrelation <span style="font-weight: bold;">C</span>oefficient (ICC).&nbsp; This package accompanies our paper on repeatability (<a href="wolakcv.html" target="_blank">Wolak et al., (2011) Guidelines for estimating repeatability.</a>) The package includes
functions to 1) estimate the ICC and it's associated confidence limits
and 2) calculate the </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">n</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> number of individuals/groups necessary to estimate the ICC, given </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">k</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> number of observations per individual/group and a desired confidence interval width, </span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">w</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">.&nbsp; The current version is available for download from the CRAN website (<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">http://cran.r-project.org/</a>) or the project webpage at R-Forge (</span><a style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;" href="http://r-forge.r-project.org/" target="_blank">http://r-forge.r-project.org/</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">).</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">&nbsp; Please feel free to leave feedback through the GitHub page for ICC.</span><br>

      			<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Line Cross Analyses</h3>

I am currently developing an R package to perform joint scaling
tests.&nbsp; A joint scaling test (JST) uses the relationships between
generation means of two parental populations, F1, F2, and backcrosses
to estimate the magnitude and standard errors of net genetic components
responsible for the differences in phenotype observed between two
populations (for further information, see Lynch and Walsh . 1998.
Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits).&nbsp; JSTs are
goodness-of-fit tests, assessed by least-squares regression, between
the observed generation means and the expected generation means under a
particular genetic model. Functions in the package will include the
basic joint scaling test, model comparisons using log-likelihood,
visual presentation of observed and modeled data, and a way to pick and
choose modeled effects from among many genetic effects available.&nbsp;
I hope to have preliminary versions of the package on GitHub
soon.&nbsp; Again, please send me any and all comments about what to include in this
package.
