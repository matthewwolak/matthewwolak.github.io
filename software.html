		  <p>The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a commonly used and widespread summary statistic. The ICC is a ratio of variances and measures repeatability and can also be used to assess measurement error. Both of these uses are popular across a very diverse range of scientific fields, such as: agricultural production and animal health, human health, geology, biochemistry, psychology, and ecology & evolutionary biology.</p> 

		  <p>I have created the <span class="code">R</span> package, <span class="code">ICC</span> to be used for the planning of experiments and analysis of data to estimate the intraclass correlation coefficient (Wolak et al. 2012). The package includes functions to 1) estimate the ICC and it's associated confidence limits and 2) calculate the <em>n</em> number of individuals/groups necessary to estimate the ICC, given <em>k</em> number of observations per individual/group and a desired confidence interval width, <em>w</em>.</p>

		  <p>The <span class="code">R</span> package <span class="code">nadiv</span>, which loosely stands for (<span class="code">N</span>on-)<span class="code">AD</span>ditive <span class="code">I</span>n<span class="code">V</span>erses, was created to facilitate the estimation of additive and non-additive genetic variances using linear mixed effects models (often referred to as <em>animal models</em>). The package includes functions to compute the inverse of autosomal and sex-chromosomal additive, autosomal dominance, and autosomal epistatic (digenic) relatedness matrices from a pedigree. Other handy (<em>I think</em>) functions standardize some pedigree manipulation and simulation procedures.</p>

		  <p>Output from <span class="code">nadiv</span> can be used by some mixed model software programs (e.g., MCMCglmm, ASReml, & WOMBAT). There are a number of other functions included in the package that are quite useful when dealing with pedigrees or running animal models. For example, <span class="code">proLik()</span> constructs profile likelihoods of variance components from an ASReml-R mixed model, <span class="code">aiFun()</span> creates a (co)variance and correlation matrix from the sampling (co)variances of the random effects in an ASReml-R model object. Also, <span class="code">findDFC()</span> will show you which pairs of individuals in a pedigree are double first cousins as well as indicate the number of families where you get these relationships. Knowing this information is useful for understanding the extent to which maternal permanent environment effects can be separated from dominance genetic effects.</p>

		<h4>Non-additive genetic variances</h4>

		  <p>Wolak (2012) gives explanations for some of the main functions in <span class="code">nadiv</span>. The paper includes Supplementary Information, which contains examples on how to use the output of <span class="code">nadiv</span> in MCMCglmm, ASReml-R, ASReml, and WOMBAT.</p>




		<h4>Sex-linkage/Haplodiploidy</h4>
		  <p>The <span class="code">R</span> package <span class="code">nadiv</span> contains functions to construct sex-chromosomal additive genetic relatedness matrices in the case of X/Z chromosomes. The relatedness matrices are analagous to the typical numerator relationship matrix (often referred to as <b>A</b>), but reflect the covariance among relatives as a result of the different inheritance patterns of sex chromosomes as compared to the autosomes. Note that this inheritance pattern is also the same as what would be expected in haplodiploid organisms (e.g., among some insects)</p>

		  <p>The functions to construct the inverse of the sex-chromosomal additive genetic relatedness matrices implement algorithms I developed<!-- TODO link to chapter of dissertation --> for different models of global sex-chromosomal dosage compensation (e.g., random X-inactivation). These algorithms are based on Fernando & Grossman (TAG 1990 vol. 80). With these matrices, researchers can estimate sex-linked additive genetic variances using a range of mixed model software programs that allow users to supply genearlized inverse covariance matrices (i.e., ASReml, WOMBAT, MCMCglmm).</p>

		  <p>In addition, there are functions to trace the inheritance of the Y/W chromosomes and create factors to then use a mixed model to estimate the variance due to Y/W chromosomes.</p>

      		  <h2>Line Cross Analyses</h2>
		  <p>I am currently developing an R package to perform joint scaling tests. A joint scaling test (JST) uses the relationships between generation means of two parental populations, F1, F2, and backcrosses to estimate the magnitude and standard errors of net genetic components responsible for the differences in phenotype observed between two populations (for further information, see Lynch and Walsh . 1998. Genetics and Analysis of Quantitative Traits). JSTs are goodness-of-fit tests, assessed by least-squares regression, between the observed generation means and the expected generation means under a particular genetic model. Functions in the package will include the basic joint scaling test, model comparisons using log-likelihood, visual presentation of observed and modeled data, and a way to pick and choose modeled effects from among many genetic effects available. I hope to have preliminary versions of the package on GitHub soon. Again, please send me any and all comments about what to include in this package.</p>
