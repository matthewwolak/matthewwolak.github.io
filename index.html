        		<h1>Matthew Wolak</h1>
				<p>I'm a biologist endeavouring to discover and describe differences among individuals within a population in the way that they look, behave, and perform. The goal of my research is to measure genetic and environmental factors that create variability in a population. Armed with these measurements, I can then make quantitative predictions about changes in the distribution of trait values within and between generations. My results contribute to general scientific knowledge on the way organisms interact with their environments (where the environment can mean a harsh winter, a predator, or even the behavior of a neighbor) and the genetic and non-genetic inheritance of characteristics across time and generations. My contributions have been applied (directly by me or by others) to the conservation of threatened or endagered species, agricultural breeding practices, and human medical practices. </p>

<!-- TODO: include links to above contributions: either my papers or papers of others. Maybe also put as bulleted/numbered list (probably not separate from paragraph) -->

				<p>My research programe employs several complementary approaches that allow me to integrate techniques and ideas from different fields of research into my own work. I study a variety of organisms in several different settings: 
	<ul> 
		<li> completely un-managed, natural populations </li>
		<li> wild caught individuals that are used for laboratory breeding designs </li>
		<li> artificially selected lines of laboratory populations. </li>
	</ul> 


<!-- TODO: include links to research page for above points -->


I also use computer simulations to study biology <em>in silico</em> to create and test theory and test statistical methods. I also develop statistical methods and software to be used by other researchers.</p>

				<p>On these pages, you can read more about specific <a href="/research">research projects</a>, <a href="/software">software</a> I have created or am currently developing, or my previous <a href="/cv">experience and accomplishments</a>.</p>
