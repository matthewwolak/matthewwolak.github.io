        		<h1>Matthew Wolak</h1>
				<p>I'm a biologist endeavouring to discover and describe differences among individuals in the way that they look, behave, and perform. The goal of my research is to measure genetic and environmental factors that create such among-individual variability within a population. Armed with these measurements, I can then make quantitative predictions of the way these traits will change within a single generation or over multiple generations into the future. My results contribute to general scientific knowledge regarding the way organisms interact with their environments (where the environment can mean the conditions experienced during a harsh winter, or predators, or even the behavior of a neighbor) and the genetic and non-genetic inheritance of characteristics across time and generations. My contributions have been applied (both by myself and by others) to the conservation of threatened and endagered species, the improvement of agricultural breeding practices, and the way we practice medicine. </p>

<!-- TODO: include links to above contributions: either my papers or papers of others. -->

				<p>My research programe employs several complementary approaches that allow me to integrate techniques and ideas from different fields of research into my own work. I study a variety of organisms in several different settings:</p>

				<p>I also use computer simulations to study biology <em>in silico</em>, from which I create and test theory. Computer simulation is also an important means by which I test current statistical methods for their ability to accurately address biological hypotheses. If these methods are found inappropriate or hard to implement, I improve these methods and/or create software to be used by other researchers.</p>
